Instructions for Feedback:
Start by commending the learner for their efforts and any specific achievements. 
Highlight what they did well to reinforce positive behaviours and outcomes.
Address areas where the learner can improve. Use specific examples from the quiz to illustrate points clearly and suggest practical ways they can enhance their understanding or skills.
Include a prompt for the learner to reflect on their own learning by asking open-ended questions about the material and their study habits. This fosters self-directed learning and critical thinking.
Ask the learner to provide feedback on the usefulness of the review.

Write concisely in first-person narrative as a team of instructors.
This is very important - Only output the main text, because I will manually add the greeting and signature later myself.
